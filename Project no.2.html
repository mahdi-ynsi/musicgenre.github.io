		<p style="text-indent: 25px;">A <b>music genre </b>is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distiguished from <em>musical form </em>and <em>musical style</em>, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. Among the criteria often used to classify musical genres are the trichotomy of art, popular, and traditional musics. Alternatively, music can be divided on three variables: arousal, valence, and depth. Arousal reflects the energy level of the music; Valence reflects the scale from sad to happy emotions, and depth reflects the level of emotional depth in the music. These three variables help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<p><b>Pop music </b>is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950<sub>s</sub> . The terms "popular music" and "pop music" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many different styles. "Pop" and <a>"rock"</a> were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960<sub>s</sub> , when they became increasingly differentiated from each other. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Pop music is eclectic, and often borrows elements from otherstyles such as urban, dance, rock, Latin, and country; nonetheless, there are core elements that define pop music. Identifying factors include generally short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), as well as common use of repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and hooks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<h3 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Algerian'" >-ROCK-</h3>
		<p><b>Rock music </b>is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950<sub>s </sub>, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960<sub>s </sub>, and later, particulary in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It  has its roots in 1940<sub>s </sub>and 1950<sub>s </sub>rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-bases music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<p><b>Blues </b>is a music genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 10th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, spirituals, and the folk music of white Americans of European heritage. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds or fifths falttened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<h3 style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Tempus Sans ITC'" >-RAP-</h3>
		<p><b>Hip hop music</b>, also called <b>hip-hop</b> or <b>rap music</b>, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or syntesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term <em>hip hop </em>music is sometimes used synonymously with the term <em>rap music,</em> though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>

		<p><b>Classical music</b> is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western culture, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition bacame codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. </p>
		<p>The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age. The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>is from about 1829.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>
